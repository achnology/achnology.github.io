### Summary üìù
This coursework consists of a responsive web application with three main functional HTML pages using Supabase as the backend. The project is made for:

- Searching people by name or license number
- Searching vehicles by registration number
- Adding vehicles to the database with either existing or new owners

Accessibility, performance, and layout stability were addressed based on Lighthouse audits and Supabase testing.
